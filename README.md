### Hi there ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

I'm currently sharpening my skills as a Full Stack React developer and looking to collaborate!

My alter-ego is a trip-pop artist called [Leach](https://loveleach.com/), whose website I built in React using Chakra and functional components. Right now I'm working on a full-stack [Morning Page](words.stuartlea.ch) app that allows users to create and save journal entries in the style of Julia Cameron's "Morning Pages," a method of daily free-writing.
